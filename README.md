# windowsearch
Window searching algorithm to be used to distinguish local irrigation-induced forcing from larger-scale climate forcings in a spatial dataset of a response variable (e.g., T2m, LST).

## Method
The method to reconstruct the irrigation imprint on temperature relies on three steps:

1. 
2.
